## Deviations from original plan





## Features...

(I had not come so far as I thought, I had many other challenges on the way. I would like to come back and finish this someday. However, most of the testing, logging-in, and signing-out does work, as well as user creating with the user).

- Creating a profile.
- Logging in
- Signing in / out
- Ability to post (goes nowhere did not finish in time)
- Dark/Mode switch

### Working Links...

- /   (the homepage)
